# Maze Solver
This piece of code solves a maze using graph, edge, and node objects. It solves the maze in two ways, recursively and non-recursively. It print outs the frame by frame (unit by unit) of the path found, if found. The program reads in the maze#.txt files, creates a maze and then solves it. Please find the .txt files in the repository. 

## Compilation
